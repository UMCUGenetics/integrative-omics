"""
	Set of scripts intended to link SVs to genes by rules based on gains and losses of regulatory elements caused by TAD disruptions

	The idea is that we first make a 'neighborhood' in which all regulatory elements are assigned to genes (regulator set).
	These are the regulatory elements within the TAD of the gene, and specifically what is linked to the gene in the data for eQTLs, promoters and enhancers.
	Then we look at the TADs that are disrupted by SVs, and determine how the interactions between genes and regulatory elements are re-wired.

	The setup of these scripts is:
	
	- The main script where the input (genes) are parsed and the relevant scripts are called
	- The neighborhoodDefiner, which takes the genes as input and assigns their regulator set. It also accepts SVs as input, and then makes a call to link them to the genes.
	- The derivativeTADMaker, which for each SV determines how the TAD is disrupted, and then assigns to each gene what the gains and losses in the regulator set are.
	- The geneRanking script, which then takes the genes and SVs that are linked to these, and outputs a list of SV-gene pairs and which regulatory elements are gained and lost for that gene.
	This used to provide a ranking, but not anymore. It also outputs the bags used for mulitple instance learning.

	The main script has 4 input parameters:
	- the uuid; this will be the output name of the folder that the data is written to.
	- permutationYN; if set to True, will randomly shuffle the SVs.
	- permutationRound; if running multiple permutations, this can be assigned a different value to get different output files for each run within the uuid folder.
	- path; path to where the settings (with all data locations) can be found.
